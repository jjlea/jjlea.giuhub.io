Research interests
======
•	Identifying disease-relevant genomic loci and pinpointing causal variants by integrating GWAS and other omics data.

•	Integrating human genetics and single-cell data to reveal candidate genes and their involved biological pathways and cell types associated with complex diseases.

•	Investigating the interplay between human genetics and environmental factors to understand their combined effects on diseases.
